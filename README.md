# getIP
getIP.py is a simple script to resolve and locate hostnames and IPs with one quick command. 
It works on both Linux and Windows.

        Usage:
                python3 getIP.py
                python3 getIP.py [-hsig] [-t {target}]


        Options:
                -h / --help : shows this help dialog
                -s / --simple : returns the IP nothing else
                -i / --no-internet-check : skips the internet check; use it if your connection is slow
                -g / --geolocate : locate the found IP afterwards
                -t / --target : specifies the target; it can be a hostname or an IP


        Requirements:
                Python 3.x

That's it!
